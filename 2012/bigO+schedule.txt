/*
	Big (O) Notation - O(1) < O (logn) < O (n) < O (n.logn) < O (n^2) < O (n^3)
	
	Schedule for Today -
	(1) Double pointers and multi-dimensional arrays (done)
	(2) Basic Sorting (The first three approaches) - (done)
	(3) Basic Recursion, searching (Binary approach), definitely the recursion tree - some recursion questions as well (Done)
	(4) Advanced Sorting (might not program it) 
	
	Then do the challenging and dirty array, strings, and other problems {All day tomorrow}
	
	- Start off linked list - Mostly quick functions
	- Trees - Mostly quick functions
	- Object oriented design (heavy coding)
